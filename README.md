XBT / IRC torrent fetcher

I started this project on 2004 and has a lot bugs, spanish words, errors.

It was designed for the Animersion community, but later several options were addes ( Hermeticos, PuntoTorrent )

It currently works for XBT and XBTT trackers and it's tested on Linux platforms.

### Requirements

- Qt5
- Ulxmlrpcpp
- libcommuni
- A C++ compiler
- Doxygen ( if you want to generate docs )
